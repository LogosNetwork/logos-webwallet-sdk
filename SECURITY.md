# Security Policy

At Logos, we take security very seriously. If you have found a security bug with Logos, we ask that you follow the below process to share security bugs with us in a responsible way. This process allows us to review and resolve the issue and keep our users and network safe while providing you public recognition for the submission.

## Logos Bug Program

If you have found a security bug, please email us directly to responsibly report the bug to Logos.

We recognize the security researchers and individuals who have had confirmed bug reports submitted through the program. We do this to publically recognize the researchers for the hard work they have done, and also to show them respect for responsibly reporting security bugs through the program.

## Contact us
